This version solves the FRG equations in a Taylor expansion with fixed point, and tune the expansion point automatically.
 Calculating different temperature and chemical potential points. 
We reduce Nv to Nv=5.
Calculate baryon number fluctuations.
Double precision.
We change the integral variable k to t.
we expand chemical potential with mu^2.
